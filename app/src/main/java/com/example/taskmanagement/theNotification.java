package com.example.taskmanagement;


//Responsible for sending pop up notifications to user's phone
//depending on how android studio handles notifications, we might not need this class.

//Responding to this ^
//Android Studio already has a built in method for handling Notifications but I think...
//depending on how *we* handle notifications, we might need this
//If we only show a notification when a task is near its date then we dont need it, imo
public class theNotification {
    //be able to do custom notifications like.. a day before, week before, x weeks before
}
