//I do not know what this class is responsible for, I need more clarification and examples
//Clarification from Eden:
/* I dont know if we need a class to do this, however we need a way to store tasks that the user wants to keep in a way that is not just temporary.
*   I have a feeling if we just used a large vector to store all the data that we need from sessoin to session on the app, it would be temporary and the phone would delete it
*   So we need a more permenant solution for this. As it stands now, I think that it actually is ok that we dont have a database, as we can test all our methods with
*   functions that only use temporary, made-up data, however this is still a very imporatnat problem that needs to be solved soon.
*
*   Also, thank you Pouria for researching this. */
